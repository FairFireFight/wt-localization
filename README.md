This repository contains my localization mod, which changes the names of vehicles in War Thunder to be more consistent and remove ambiguity while also keeping the names as close to default in possible. In other words, the overwhelming majority of vehicles have their default names on the surface, but they all show their full names on the killfeed and at long range. Other notable changes include Early and Late being shown for both vehicles instead of just one, a sun icon for ROC vehicles, and the choice of having default or unique symbols for French and Italian vehicles (more on that later). 

The version of the commit reflects the version of War Thunder the mod was updated to. When the dev server is open, version numbers will end in an even number (if 2.19 is the live server, then 2.20 is the dev server) until the update is released; these dev server versions should work on the live server client without issue. 

I will try to keep this repository as up to date as possible. If you need to nudge me to update it or if you have any other problems, feel free to reach out to me on discord: JÃ¦k#5326

## Instructions

There are two main folders on this repository, Vanilla and Modded. The Vanilla folder contains localization datamined straight from the game, as-is, without any changes to any of the files. 
Within each version you'll find a lang folder and a zip file. The zip file allows you to easily download the complete lang folder. The unzipped folder contains the same files, which can be seen and saved individually for more advanced users.
